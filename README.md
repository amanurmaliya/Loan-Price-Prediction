## Business Problem Understanding
Dream Housing Finance Company deals in home loans across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. This project automates the loan eligibility process in real-time based on customer details submitted during an online application.

### Objectives
- Automate loan eligibility prediction.
- Target specific customer segments effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Number of Dependents
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Other features

## Methodology
CRISP-DM was used for structured project development.

### Steps:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Selectiong Final Model

## Machine Learning Models Evaluated
1. Logistic Regression
2. SVM
3. KNN
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Random Forest Classifier
6. AdaBoost
7. Gradient Boost
8. XGBoost

### Final Model: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Reason**: Simplicity and efficiency (requires one feature column).
- Logistic Regression was also accurate but used ten feature columns.
- SVM and KNN were deprioritized due to longer computation times.
